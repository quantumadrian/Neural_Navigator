# Neural_Navigator
## Empowering individuals with ADHD through technology!

### Overview
People with ADHD often face challenges that traditional productivity and learning tools fail to address. Burnout is common ‚Äî not due to lack of effort, but because conventional study methods are rigid and ignore neurodiverse learning styles.

Beyond academics, ADHD symptoms like time blindness, task paralysis, and emotional dysregulation make it extremely difficult to plan, prioritize, and stay on track. Many existing tools target one of these issues ‚Äî like a focus timer, a calendar, or a mood tracker ‚Äî but none offer a unified system that ADHD users can rely on.

Research shows that juggling multiple apps can actually make things worse. According to ADDitude Magazine, the mental overhead of switching between scattered tools often increases stress, overload, and avoidance behaviors ‚Äî exactly what ADHD brains struggle with most.

This inspired us to create **Neural Navigator** ‚Äî an **all-in-one** AI-powered workspace built specifically for people with ADHD. Instead of forcing users to adapt to tools designed for neurotypical workflows, our platform adapts to them: streamlining scheduling, studying, and emotional regulation into one cohesive space. With real-time support powered by Google Cloud and Gemini AI, Neural Navigator helps ADHD minds work with ‚Äî not against ‚Äî how they function best.
